Debug.Log("Hello"); THese print to the console 

integer variables are called int, then we name them starting with a lowercase letter
ex: int myAgeIs

input variable is called if(input.....
ex if (input.GetKeyDown(""))......
This makes it so when you press a specific key it appears on the console

Resets the min guess to whatever the current guess is
            lowestGuess = guess
            
Calculates a new average for a guess
            guess = (lowestGuess + maxGuess) / 2;
            
Presents the new guess to the user if wrong
            Debug.Log("Worng? Ok, my mind says the new number is..." + guess);
